		<p>My name is Yile Wu, I am from Hangzhou, China. I double major in Accounting and Management Information System. I am 23 and I am the single child. 
		I studied in boarding school for middle school. I lived in a apartment myself during high school. I also spent one year in a Chinese University before
		I came to America. This is my 11th year live away from my home. </p>
		
		<p>I love animals, especially pandas. This winter break, I spent three days taking care of pandas in a city where locates southwest of China.
		I also like collecting antiques. I like experiencing new cultures and trying different sports; I love food and you usually will see the pictures 
		that I upload on Facebook are food; but my cooking is really bad. I would like to try any food that I never see before and one of my biggest 
		goals is to try all the Chinese food before I turn 40!
